## ðŸ’¡ My Assumptions

- There can be only **one store**.
- There can be **multiple users** sharing the same store.
- I encountered **ambiguity in product expiry**:
  - If I assume that all items in a given product share the same expiry date, that doesnâ€™t make sense.
  - Also, if some of the product units are expired, the test case uses `cart.add(product, quantity)`, which doesnâ€™t allow the user to select specific units.
  - So I assumed expired items are **automatically excluded**, and the user cannot manually pick between expired and non-expired items.
