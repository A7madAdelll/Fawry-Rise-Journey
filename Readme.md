# Fawry E-Commerce System

This project is a TypeScript-based simulation of an e-commerce system, including products, inventory management, cart operations, and a controller for checking product availability.

## ðŸ›  Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or higher recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

## ðŸ“¦ Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:

2. **run those lines** 
 ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/A7madAdelll/Fawry-Rise-Journey.git
   cd Fawry-Rise-Journey
   npx ts-node src/demo.ts
   ```



## My assumptions:

    -there can be only one store 
    -there can be multible users sharing the same store
    - i got ambiguty in the expire dates if i assume that the   whole items in the exact product has the same expiry date that makes no sense and also if there is some of the products expired then in the test case the function provided cart.add(product,quantity) so there is no selection for the user to choose.
